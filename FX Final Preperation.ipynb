    "1. Look for most important (non-parametric) shocks that tend to drive moves in the whole curve\n",
    "2. Use historical daily interest rate spread moves, particularly covariances between them, to figure out the factors\n",
    "3. In practice people do not use this very much\n",
    "    - Non-parametric shocks are hard to understand properly\n",
    "        - Can have unusual shapes due to specific data points in the history you’re using\n",
    "    - Non-parametric shock shapes change over time\n",
    "        - Do you fix the shock shape based on a particular historical run?\n",
    "        - Do you recalculate the shock shapes every day based on rolling historical runs?\n",
    "    - Together they make traders unsure what their risk numbers mean\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factor models\n",
    "We’ll focus on forward curve models\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dS(t,T)=\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sigma_i(t,T)dz_i(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S is term interest rate spread for tenor T as seen at time t\n",
    "\n",
    "Can compare the model covariances with historical covariances to calibrate\n",
    "\n",
    "The two factor model can give shocks that look a lot like the first two principal component shocks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### compare this two methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis and factor models are two different techniques for reducing dimensionality in a high-dimensional system. In this example we were looking at these techniques as ways of reducing the dimensionality of non-USD interest rate curve hedging for a book of FX forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis is a non-parametric method for discovering the main factors driving the moves in the interest rate curve. It involves calculating the historical covariances of day-on-day changes in interest rates of different tenors (assuming that each day’s sample for a given tenor is drawn from the same distribution on each day of the historical period), then orthogonalizing that covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the orthogonal shocks to the curve, and the eigenvalues represent the relative sizes of those shocks. Principal component analysis involves picking off the top N largest eigenvalues and approximating all moves in the curves as being linear combinations of the respective eigenvectors. The shapes of the shocks are an output of the calculation and are non-parametric.\n",
    "\n",
    "A factor model assumes a stochastic differential equation driving interest rates of different tenors, where all tenors are shocked by a small number of Brownian motion factors. The shocks in a factor model are parametric: their functionality forms are determined by the model parameter (for example, exponential shocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the two approaches is that PCA results in non-parametric shocks, whereas a factor model has parametric shocks. Non-parametric shocks give more flexibility in terms of shape of the shocks, but also less robustness (historical data artifacts can lead to odd shapes). Parametric shocks are more robust and easier for traders to understand, but have less flexibility that PCA’s non-parametric shocks.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### smile\n",
    "Smile comes from volatility of volatility, paired with the symmetric vega gamma profile of vanilla options. If you buy a high-strike or a low-strike vanilla, you have a position that is long vega gamma and long vega. You can sell enough ATM vanilla to vega hedge the position; ATM options have zero vega gamma, so the position is still long vega gamma. Now, whichever way vol moves, you make money. That means traders tend to buy up high- and low-strike options and sell ATM options, which increases implied volatilities for high- and low-strike options vs the ATM implied volatility. That market pressure creates the implied volatility smile (symmetric because vega gamma is positive for both high- and low-strike options).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### skew \n",
    "Skew comes from spot/vol correlation, paired with the asymmetric vega dspot profile of vanilla options. Assume spot/vol correlation is positive: if you buy a high-strike option, you have a position with long vega dspot and long vega. ATM options have zero vega dspot, so if you sell enough ATM vanilla to hedge vega, your position is long vega dspot and flat vega. Then if spot goes up, your vega turns positive; and you expect vol to go up because of the positive correlation, so you expect to make money. Similarly if spot goes down, vega turns negative right as you expect vol to go down because of the positive correlation, so you make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had bought a low-strike option instead, and put on a negative vega dspot position, you would lose money if spot goes up or down. This PNL behavior causes traders to buy high-strike options and sell low-strike options, creating a positive implied volatility smile.\n",

    "If spot/vol correlation is negative, all the signs change, and traders want to sell high-strike options and buy low-strike options, creating a negative implied volatility smile.\n",

If I’m long a down-and-out knockout call, I can sell the regular call (same strike as the knockout) and buy a put whose strike is the knockout strike “reflected” through the barrier: B2/K. That two-vanilla portfolio hedges almost all my market risk unless the barrier is hit – then I need to unwind it. The **cost of unwinding** that two-vanilla portfolio when spot is at the barrier is mostly a function of risk reversal, because at that point the call and put are (roughly) equally out-of-the-money. That means their net sensitivity to ATM vol is small, as is their net sensitivity to butterfly. That portfolio is sensitive only to the level of risk reversal. The expected level of risk reversal is determined by how much we think risk reversal will have moved while spot moved down to the barrier, which is basically our measure of risk reversal beta: the regression coefficient of moves in risk reversal with moves in spot."

The vol swap then looks like a square-root payoff against the variance swap, which is non-linear dependence. That means **you need to keep rebalancing** the notional of the short variance swap, much like **you’d need to keep rebalancing the notional of a delta hedge** against a short option position. And much the same way, you expect to **lose money** doing so, as it’s a **short gamma position** (in the case of a vol swap it’s short gamma to the variance swap fair strike; in the case of a vanilla option it’s short gamma to the underlying spot). You then expect to lose money over time running a long vol swap position, and you get compensated for that by being able to enter the vol swap at a fair strike that’s less than the square root of the variance swap fair strike.  The discount in fair strike depends on the realized volatility of the variance swap fair strike, which is roughly the same as realized volatility of implied volatility."
