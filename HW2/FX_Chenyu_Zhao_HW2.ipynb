    "We start by assuming a toy market: spot = 1, asset currency interest rate curve = Q(T) = flat at 3%, and denominated currency interest rate curve = R(T) = flat at 0%. We assume two benchmark dates, T1 = 0.25y and T2 = 1y; we will use forwards to those settlement dates to hedge the forward rate risk (or equivalently, the risk to moves in the asset currency interest rate) of our portfolio.\n",

    "The portfolio to hedge has one position: a unit asset-currency notional of a forward contract settling at time T. You’ll try this for values of T in [0.1,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,2] to see how performance changes for portfolios with risk to different tenors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will try three different hedging strategies: one where you choose the hedge notionals (of forwards settling at times T1 and T2) based on the triangle shock we discussed in class (though as there are only two benchmarks here, the T1 shock will be flat before T1 and the T2 shock will be flat after T2); one where the notionals are set to hedge the actual two shocks from the factors described above; and lastly, one where you don’t hedge at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result should show that setting hedge notionals based on the true factor shocks should provide a better hedge performance than based on the ad hoc triangle shocks. You should analyze just how much better that performance is.\n",

    "Run a Monte Carlo simulation where you do the following on each run, for each value of T, for each of the three hedging strategies described above:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Construct a portfolio long 1 unit of the forward settling at time T\n",
    "    2. Add in the hedges: two forwards, settling at times T1 and T2, with notionals set to hedge the portfolio (either against the two triangle shocks or against the two factor shocks). Don’t bother adding the hedges in the third hedge scenario where we leave the portfolio unhedged.\n",
    "    3. Simulate the portfolio forward a time dt=0.001y. That will result in the asset-currency rates moving according to the factor model described above, which shocks the benchmark rates for tenors T1 and T2, and for the portfolio’s risk tenor T. Determine the PNL realized. \n",
    "Then construct the PNL distributions for the three hedging approaches. The unhedged version is the benchmark: you should compare how much more effectively the PNL standard deviation is reduced by hedging according to the true factors vs hedging according to the ad hoc triangle shocks.\n",
